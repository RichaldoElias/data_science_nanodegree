The Idea of this checklist is to ensure that I follow the CRISP-DM.

The CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is a process model that serves as the base for a data science process. It has six sequential phases:

Business understanding – What does the business need?
Data understanding – What data do we have / need? Is it clean?
Data preparation – How do we organize the data for modeling?
Modeling – What modeling techniques should we apply?
Evaluation – Which model best meets the business objectives?
Deployment – How do stakeholders access the results?



What I am going to do in the project:

1. Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.
2. Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages you'd like, to:
    Prepare data:
        Gather necessary data to answer your questions
        Handle categorical and missing data
        Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them
    Analyze, Model, and Visualize
        Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them
Communicate your business insights:
    Create a Github repository to share your code and data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind
    Create a blog post to share your questions and insights with a non-technical audience
