# data_science_nanodegree
This Repository is just for testing all the concepts learned during the nanodegree

In this project we are going to use the IBM telco churn dataset.

## Project Motivation
I work for a telco company and this dataset in interesting because churn is a common problem in telco environment.
Aside of that, It is a good working ground, where I can use most of the concepts that are discussed on the nanodegree and 
use a formal approach to a data science project.


## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
To run this code you need to install the requirement file in this repository using conda:

```
conda install requirements.txt
```
